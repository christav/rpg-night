_For the first session, Phil, Christopher, and Drew gathered to collaboratively kick off the campaign, by asking leading questions and then following them with more. We tried not to answer too much, both because not everyone was present, and because we wanted just enough to get the campaign rolling (leaving plenty of room for later development.)_

#### Which game rules?
D&D 5e.

#### Do we use an existing campaign world or start with a blank slate?
Blank slate.

#### What makes this world special or unique?
It's a post-apocalyptic world of survivors living above the ruins of a long-gone, vast subterranean empire about which very little is known. These ruins are collectively called the Underworld. Inexplicably strange things often happen in the Underworld: time might pass differently, natural laws (such as gravity) may or may not apply, magic sometimes gives wild results, and twisted, magical beasts often emerge from the depths. Most of the world above ignores the Underworld, but some cannot ignore its luring promises of fortune and glory.

Top-side settlements are few and far between. While there are some city-states with regional influence, most settlements stand alone and govern themselves. Most of the world is wild and dangerous, filled with bad people, wild beasts, and fell Underworld creatures that ventured above. Travelling, even by established roads, is dangerous and best done with guards.

#### What is the nature of arcane magic?
Magic is rare and mysterious, and those who can control and wield it are rarer still. Each mage casts magic differently, and no two spells are quite the same. No mage can truly explain how magic works, and all attempts to teach magic to an apprentice have failed. The onset of magic use is different for each mage.

Mages are feared but also generally distrusted, if not hated. A burgeoning society of scholarly mages, still kept tightly secret, seeks to explain magic and to better control it.

#### What is the nature of faith magic?
There is no well-established religion pervasive throughout the world. Some regions favor anscetor-worship, some worship nature or the elements, some believe in local deities, and some have no religion at all. Some who cast magic claim to do so through faith, or as a gift from a divine source, but most don't seen any difference between arcane and faith magic.

#### Is magic a remnant of the Underworld?
The secret society believes the genesis of magic lies in the Underworld, and that the Underworld is where they can learn more about magic.

#### What is the society's goal?
To learn the secrets of magic. They aren't good or evil; they put the study and use of magic above all else.

#### How do folks travel?
There are horses, used mostly in trade and by the rich. Most folks walk. There are few well-maintained roads, and even these are not paved. Most travel is done via well-worn paths.

#### Where is the game initially set?
The initial settlement is a medium-sized town called Riverfork (not surprisingly, nested in the fork of a large river). The town is home to a couple thousand residents and is several square miles in size. Riverfork is not itself a commercial hub, but is a major stop along two trade routes (one by river, one by land). There is a lot of traffic through Riverfork.

Riverfork is a growing settlement. It's built on the site of a far older settlement, going back many, many generations. In the time ago, it was just a small town on a small lake; there was no river then. Two warring tribes often raided the town and battled over the then-precious source of water. One day, a man appeared, promising to bring fortune and peace to the town, in exchange for a life of ease and a position of leadership as long as he lived. The town accepted, not really believing he could deliver on this promise.

The man then left, headed for the mountains to the west. He returned a year and a day later. A new river followed behind him, surging and scoring the earth with each of his footsteps. He stopped just outside of the town, held his arms wide, and the river split in two. Each fork lead toward one of the two warring tribes. The river wiped the tribes away, leaving no trace of them.

Peace ensued, and soon trade came to and through Rivefork. This mysterious man lived four generations. He died only a few years ago. He is known simply as The Founder, and a statue in his honor stands tall in the middle of town. When he came back from them mountain, he bore a strange birthmark on his forehead, and the statue bears this as well.

#### What three things make Riverfork interesting?
1. A volcanic mountain range lies to the West. It is rumoured to have connections to the Underworld, and shrines either made by or for The Founder. It also might hold the secret or story of how The Founder made the river.
2. Piracy is growing on the river. There have always been pirates, but lately they are both bolder and more succesfull. Rumor has it they have some new weapon or secret hidden away in a slough which they fiercely protect.
3. The Founder's story is of great interest, both to travelers and to the society. The society has coincidentally used the _exact_ same mark as the Founder's Mark since its inception, having linked it to the practice of magic in an early expedition into the Underworld. The mysterious coincidence, if that is what it is, is of great interest to the society. They recently established a base in Riverfork to investigate further.

#### What previous adventure did Luther and Zo have?

Luther and Zo initially bonded over the Founder's Mark. Zo has it tattooed on his inner forearm (as part of his initiation into the society). Luther has the mark naturally on his inner forearm, as a birthmark.

Zo has a long history of sleepwalking to far off places. These episodes often lead to discoveries, or to new understandings of magic. Zo wanted to return to the site of a recent sleepwalk, where he thought he might have discovered a strange race of creatures that controlled darkness. He recruited Luther to accompany him. They ended up losing their way in the dark night of the forest, though, and stumbled instead into a den of small green creatures that resembled furry, bright green balls dominated by a huge toothy maw and spindly legs and arms. They barely escaped the den alive.
