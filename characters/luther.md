_**Second Wind**_. You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

_**Fighting Stye (Two-Weapon Fighting)**_. When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

_**Rustic Hospitality**_. Since you come from the ranks of the common folk, you fit in among them with ease. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.

## Notes
- Luther was born in a distant settlement and never knew his father. His mother said his father resided in the Riverfork settlement, but would never say anything more.
- Luther has a rune-like birthmark on his inner forearm. Upon arriving in Riverfork, he found the same mark on the forehead of The Founder statue. Zo also has a tatto bearing the same mark, which he took as part of an initiation ritual into some secret group he's trying to join.
- Luther is currently residing in Riverfork trying to learn something about his father or his family's past. His only lead so far is The Founder. Could The Founder be his father? Do the volcanic mountains to the east, where The Founder sojourned and made the river, hold any clues?
